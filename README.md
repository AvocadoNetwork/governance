Community governance for Avocado

Ideas for tasks and projects for Avocado can be shared as an issue [here](https://github.com/AvocadoNetwork/governance/issues).

## About Avocado
On March 1st, 2018, 9000 CryptoKitties players were chosen at random to receive an airdrop of 100m AVO tokens each. The reasoning for this was because CK players were recognized as creative, innovative, and positive users of crypto. This action has been dubbed the world's first reverse-ICO, bringing people together for the purpose of community and collaboration. 

Around the time of March 18th the original creator of AVO token suddenly disappeared and took all projects and social media platforms related to AVO with them. They also burned their own supply of the tokens, reducing the number from 100 trillion to 900 billion that are now in circulation.

The community assembled here thus far had to ask: what do we do with our AVO? It would seem that the creator of this token, whoever they are, has left it up to us to decide.

## Airdrops
Telegram user "Benjamin Btc" has been kind enough to start a new distribution of 10k AVO to anyone who is interested in contributing to the project. Please ping him for details and don't forget to share about AVO on FB and Twitter! To contribute to the airdrop pool, you can donate AVO here: 0xb9F10ea6db136718416eb9e3e7322d8352e19f28

## Bounties
AVO bounties will be placed on various tasks [here](https://github.com/AvocadoNetwork/governance/issues). Please donate AVO tokens for bounties to the Avocado Bounty Pool address here: 0x7d0ebffc56429c818f34d0b46e239436fbe0fa5f

Small amounts of ETH are also very welcome for transaction fees.

## Current Goals
- As of April 2018, we are still trying to reach many original hodlers of AVO, while simultaneously trying to bring new and interested users on board. A longer-term goal of 500-1000 users is desired.
- We need a viable use case for AVO. The original project included a clicker-type dapp and a possible partnership with an ETH-based game/dapp. Other ideas include possibly partnering with local grocery chains/farmer's markets. Charity is also a viable option.
